            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>Cycling is an enjoyable activity for people of all ages. There are many reasons people ride bicycles.
                They may ride just for fun, for exercise, for transportation, or for the sport of racing. To learn more
                about bicycling, you can go to a bike shop, find a cycling club, go to the library, or check the
                Internet.</p>
